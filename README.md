# Vitaki fork

This is ywnico's fork of AAGaming's ([@AAGaming00](https://github.com/AAGaming00)) [Vitaki](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki). AAGaming did all the hard work of porting Chiaki to Vita. This fork just adds some features and fixes on top of that foundation.

This fork builds on AAGaming's work with the following updates:
1. Implemented audio
2. Implemented controls
    - Control mappings for L2, R2, L3, R3, and touchpad (trapezoid button), following the official ps4 remote play maps in `vs0:app/NPXS10013/keymap/`. Note that `Select` + `Start` sends the PS (home) button.
    - Motion controls (thanks to [@Epicpkmn11](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11), who also contributed some other controller improvements)
3. Implemented external network remote play (with manually-specified remote IP addresses)
4. Fixed console wakeup
5. Made debug logs visible, added tooltips on some buttons
6. Fixed instant disconnection bug
7. Disabled `vblank_wait` and set fps to 30 to reduce lag.
    - NOTE: the fps in the config file (`chiaki.toml`) will be ignored
8. Merged in updates from chiaki4deck (improved some connection issues)
9. Included [ghost's LiveArea icon fixes](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki/pulls/13)
10. Many bug and crash fixes

## Instructions
### Local connection
1. Connect PS Vita and PS5 (or PS4) to the same local WiFi network.
2. Log in to the same PSN account on both the PS5 and the Vita.
3. Open Vitaki on PS Vita.
4. Check settings (gear icon) to ensure your encoded PSN ID is there (if it's not automatically populated, or you accidentally deleted it, press START to re-detect it).
5. The console should be automatically detected and appear as an icon.
6. Select the console and Vitaki should ask for a registration code. On the PS5, navigate to `Settings > System > Remote Play` and select `Pair Device`. An 8-digit numeric code should appear; enter this into Vitaki and hit triangle to save.
7. Select the console again in Vitaki. It should now connect (and in the future, will not ask for the device pairing code).

### Remote connection
UDP holepunching is not supported. Instead, a remote connection requires a static IP and port forwarding.

1. Register your console on your local network following the above instructions.
2. Follow the "manual remote connection" section in [these instructions](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/setup/remoteconnection/#manual-remote-connection) to set up a static IP and port forwarding on your network.
3. Select the `add remote host` button (the leftmost button in the toolbar) in Vitaki. Enter the remote IP address and the registered console.

If you are on the local network, your console will be discovered locally and a separate tile for remote connection will not be shown. If you want to test on the local network, turn off discovery (wifi icon in the toolbar).

Currently, Vitaki cannot detect the status of remote hosts. Therefore, when selecting one, it will both send the wakeup signal and immediately try to start remote play. If the console was asleep, then this first attempt at remote play will fail, so try again in 10 or 15 seconds.

Note: if the remote host cannot be reached, it will get stuck on "Trying to request session" for 90 seconds and then time out. If the remote host was reachable but asleep, "Trying to request session" should fail after just a few seconds.

## Config settings
Some configuration lacks a UI but can be set in the config file located at `ux0:data/vita-chiaki/chiaki.toml`.
### Swapping circle/cross in UI
`circle_btn_confirm = true` swaps circle and cross in the main UI, so that circle is confirm and cross is cancel (`false` makes cross into confirm and circle into cancel). Note that this does not affect the button mappings in remote play, only in the UI before remote play starts.
### Disabling auto discovery
`auto_discovery = false` makes Vitaki not start discovery on launch. It can still be started manually by selecting the wifi icon.
### Priority hosts
The Vitaki UI is limited to 4 consoles. If you are on a crowded network with many consoles and yours isn't showing up, you can manually add the following to the config file:
```toml
[[priority_hosts]]
server_mac = "00:11:11:11:11:11"

[[priority_hosts]]
server_mac = "00:22:22:22:22:22"
```
and so on for each console you want to prioritize, where the MAC address is the LAN MAC address of your PS5/PS4 console (you can find it in `Settings > Network > Connection Status > View Connection Status`).

Note that each additional priority host should have its own `[[priority_hosts]]` header above it. Also, be sure to quote the MAC address. If Vitaki crashes immediately on opening, it is probably due to an invalid TOML file breaking the parser.

## Known issues & troubleshooting
- Latency. On remote connections (not local WLAN), it's especially bad. ([Relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/12))
- Vitaki may crash with error C2-12828-1 if incompatible plugins such as reRescaler are installed. Thanks to [@GuillermoAVeces](https://github.com/GuillermoAVeces) for identifying this. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/1)).
- Typically only one stream works per launch. If the screen becomes gray and unresponsive, restart Vitaki. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/16))
- In the past crashes occurred when multiple consoles are on the network, but this has likely been fixed. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/6)).

If problems arise:
- Try restarting Vitaki first.
- Then, try deleting/renaming the config file (`ux0:data/vita-chiaki/chiaki.toml`). 
- If that doesn't help, create a new [issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues) (or comment on an existing issue).
