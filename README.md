# Vitaki fork

This is ywnico's fork of [aa's Vitaki](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki). AA deserves all the credit for the initial port of Chiaki to Vita.

This fork builds on AA's work with the following updates:
1. Implemented audio
2. Added control mappings for L2, R2, L3, R3, and touchpad (trapezoid button), following the official ps4 remote play maps in `vs0:app/NPXS10013/keymap/`
    - Note: `Select` + `Start` sends the PS (home) button
3. Implemented remote play (with manually-specified remote IP addresses)
4. Made debug logs visible, added tooltips on some buttons
5. Fixed instant disconnection bug
6. Disabled `vblank_wait` and set fps to 30 to reduce lag.
    - NOTE: the fps in the config file (`chiaki.toml`) will be ignored
7. Merged in updates from chiaki4deck (improved some connection issues)
8. Included [ghost's LiveArea icon fixes](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki/pulls/13)
9. Many bug and crash fixes

## Instructions
### Local connection
1. Connect PS Vita and PS5 (or PS4) to the same local WiFi network.
2. Log in to the same PSN account on both the PS5 and the Vita.
3. Open Vitaki on PS Vita.
4. Check settings (gear icon) to ensure your encoded PSN ID is there (if it's not automatically populated, or you accidentally deleted it, press START to re-detect it).
5. The console should be automatically detected and appear as an icon.
6. Select the console and Vitaki should ask for a registration code. On the PS5, navigate to `Settings > System > Remote Play` and select `Pair Device`. An 8-digit numeric code should appear; enter this into Vitaki and hit circle.
7. Select the console again in Vitaki. It should now connect (and in the future, will not ask for the device pairing code).

### Remote connection
UDP holepunching is not supported. Instead, a remote connection requires a static IP and port forwarding.

1. Register your console on your local network following the above instructions.
2. Follow the "manual remote connection" section in [these instructions](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/setup/remoteconnection/#manual-remote-connection) to set up a static IP and port forwarding on your network.
3. Select the `add remote host` button (the leftmost button in the toolbar) in Vitaki. Enter the remote IP address and the registered console.

If you are on the local network, your console will be discovered locally and a separate tile for remote connection will not be shown. If you want to test on the local network, turn off discovery (wifi icon in the toolbar).

Currently, Vitaki cannot detect the status of remote hosts. Therefore, when selecting one, it will both send the wakeup signal and immediately try to start remote play. If the console was asleep, then this first attempt at remote play will fail, so try again in 10 or 15 seconds.

Note: if the remote host cannot be reached, it will get stuck on "Trying to request session" for 90 seconds and then time out. If the remote host was reachable but asleep, "Trying to request session" should fail after just a few seconds.
